Hub 1 Challenge – Asset Discovery Lab
1. Background
Asset discovery is a foundational phase of offensive security and reconnaissance. The purpose of this lab was to identify and enumerate publicly discoverable assets belonging to a target, ranging from DNS records and subdomains to hidden infrastructure and metadata. This exercise focused solely on the Asset Discovery module within Hub-1 of the ALX Cybersecurity programme.
2. Objectives
The objective of this module was to understand, enumerate, and map digital assets using a variety of open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques and tools. Specifically, the tasks aimed to:
Resolve DNS information
Enumerate name servers
Attempt DNS zone transfers
Discover subdomains through active and passive enumeration
Query external intelligence sources, such as Shodan, to identify internet-wide exposures and public-facing services
3. Scope & Limitations
All activities were performed strictly within Hub 1 – Asset Discovery.
No exercises or targets outside this hub were attempted unless explicitly instructed.
All enumeration was restricted to the designated lab environment.
All tools were used only within the approved scope of the lab and were not deployed against live or external systems without written authorization.
4. Legal & Ethical Disclaimer
All activities were conducted strictly within the authorized lab environment provided by the ALX Cybersecurity Programme.
No real-world or production systems were targeted at any point.
The environment and tools were used solely for learning and the development of cybersecurity skills.
